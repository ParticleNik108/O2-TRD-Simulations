# O2-TRD-Simulations
Codes and files for optimization of Transition Radiation Detector Simulations at ALICE CERN. 
The goal is to investigate the differences that exist between real run data
and Monte-Carlo data generated from O2 simulation software. The discrepancies that exist will then serve as a motivation to tune the parameters of the MC software that are responsible in an effort to make the 
simulation more realistic to that of real data.
