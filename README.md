# O2-TRD-Simulations
Codes and files for optimization of Transition Radiation Detector Simulations at ALICE CERN. 
The main goal is to assess the differences that exist between real run data 
and MC data generated by O2 software. These discrepancies will then serve as motivation to tune necessary parameters in the simulation that are responsible in order to make the simulation conform to real data to a greater extent.
